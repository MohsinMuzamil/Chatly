# Chatly ‚Äì Android Chat App for Learning Modern Development

Welcome to **Chatly**, a learning-focused Android chat application demonstrating modern best practices in app architecture, real-time communication, and cloud integration.  
This project is designed for students, hobbyists, and anyone interested in understanding how to build a scalable chat app using **MVVM**, **Firebase**, **Room**, and popular open-source libraries.

---

## Overview
Chatly is a modern Android chat app using:
- **MVVM** architecture
- **Room** for local database (offline support)
- **Firebase Authentication** for auth
- **Firestore** for user & message storage
- **Cloudinary** for profile photo uploads
- **Glide** for image loading

## ‚ú® What You'll Learn

- **MVVM Architecture**: How to separate UI, business logic, and data layers for maintainable code.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user login and registration.
- **Cloud Firestore**: Real-time storage and retrieval of user profiles and chat messages.
- **Room Database**: Implementing offline caching and local-first data access.
- **Cloudinary Integration**: Uploading and showing profile images from the cloud.
- **Modern UI**: Using Material Design, RecyclerView, custom views, and Glide for image loading.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Using Kotlin coroutines, StateFlow, and LiveData for reactive updates.
- **Clean Repository Pattern**: Abstracting data sources for robust, testable code.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

**Chatly** follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture:

- **UI Layer**: Activities, RecyclerViews, Adapters, and custom views (e.g., TypingIndicatorView).
- **ViewModel Layer**: Holds UI state, business logic, and exposes reactive data (LiveData/Flow).
- **Repository Layer**: Manages data sources (local Room database and remote Firebase/Cloudinary).
- **Model Layer**: Data classes for users and messages.
- **Local Database**: Room for offline support and caching.
- **Remote Services**: Firebase Auth for authentication, Firestore for real-time data, Cloudinary for image upload.

## Data Flow Example (Sending a Message)

1. **User** types and sends a message in `ChatActivity`.
2. `ChatViewModel.sendMessage()` is called.
3. `ChatRepository.sendMessage()`:
    - Stores the message in **Room** for offline support.
    - Sends the message to **Firestore** for cloud sync.
4. **Firestore** triggers updates for other users/devices.
5. UI observes Room for real-time updates.

---

## Data Models Summary

- **User/UserEntity**: uid, email, displayName, mobile, photoUrl, dob, gender
- **Message**: id, messageId, senderId, receiverId, content, timestamp, isMine

---

## Component Responsibilities

- **SplashScreenActivity**: Logo animation, auth check, route to main/greeting.
- **GreetingActivity**: Welcome screen, go to login.
- **LoginActivity/RegisterActivity**: Auth forms, state via AuthViewModel.
- **MainActivity**: User list, launches chats, handles logout.
- **ChatActivity**: One-on-one chat, message send/receive, user detail.
- **ProfileActivity/EditProfileActivity**: Show/edit profile, Cloudinary upload.
- **UserDetailActivity**: Show other user info.
- **TypingIndicatorView**: Custom view for "is typing" status.

---

## Storage Structure (Firebase)

- **Firestore**
    - `/users/{userId}`
    - `/messages/{messageId}`

- **Room (local)**
    - `user` table
    - `messages` table

- **Cloudinary**
    - Used to store profile images, save URL in Firestore.

---

## Expandability
